    <h3>Lord D.:</h3>  Indeed, we are very much obliged to her Ladyship.

  <h4><span>Kalyba:</span></h4>   Are you?  I wonder why.

  <h2><mark>Nekaya:</mark></h2>   Don't tell us if it's rude.

  <h3><Lord D.</h3> Rude?  Not at all.  We are obliged to Lady Sophy because
  she has afforded us the pleasure of seeing you.

  Nekaya:   I don't think you ought to talk to us like that.

  <h4><span>Kalyba:</span></h4>   It's calculated to turn our heads.

  <h2><mark>Nekaya:</mark></h2>  Attractive girls cannot be too particular.

  Kalyba:   Oh pray, pray do not take advantage of our unprotected
  inno-cence.

  <h3>Lord D.:</h3> But may I ask—is this extreme delicacy—this
  shrinking sensitiveness—a general characteristic of Utopian
  young ladies?

  <h2><mark>Nekaya:</mark></h2>  Oh no; we are crack specimens.

  Kalyba:   We are the pick of the basket.  Would you mind not
  coming quite so near?  Thank you.

  <h2><mark>Nekaya:</mark></h2> And please don't look at us like that; it unsettles us.

  <h4><span>Kalyba:</span></h4>  And we don't like it.  At least, we do like it; but it's
  wrong.

  <h2><mark>Nekaya:</mark></h2>  We have enjoyed the inestimable privilege of being
  educated by a most refined and easily shocked English lady, on the
  very strictest English principles.

  <h4><span>Kalyba:</span></h4>  Oh, don't!  You mustn't.  It's too affectionate.</div>


  <div><h3 ><span class="mental madhi">SONG — Mr. Goldbury.</span></h3><br>

            A wonderful joy our eyes to bless,
            In her magnificent comeliness,
            Is an English girl of eleven stone two,
            And five foot ten in her dancing shoe!
                 She follows the hounds, and on she pounds—
                      <mark>The "field" tails off and the muffs diminish—</mark>

            Over the hedges and brooks she bounds,
                 Straight as a crow, from find to finish.
            At cricket, her kin will lose or win—
                 She and her maids, on grass and clover,
            Eleven maids out—eleven maids in—
                 And perhaps an occasional <mark>"maiden over!"</mark>

                 Go search the world and search the sea,
                 Then come you home and sing with me
                 There's no such gold and no such pearl
                 As a bright and beautiful English girl!

            With a ten-mile spin she stretches her limbs,
            She golfs, she punts, she rows, she swims—
            She plays, she sings, she dances, too,
            From ten or eleven til all is blue!
                 At ball or drum, til small hours come
                     <p> (Chaperon's fans concealing her yawning)</p>
                 She'll waltz away like a teetotum.
                      And never go home til daylight's dawning.
                 Lawn-tennis may share her favours fair—
                      Her eyes a-dance, and her cheeks a-glowing—
                 Down comes her hair, but then what does she care?
                      It's all her own and it's worth the showing!
                           Go search the world, etc.

            Her soul is sweet as the ocean air,
            For prudery knows no haven there;
            To find mock-modesty, please apply
            To the conscious blush and the downcast eye.
                 Rich in the things contentment brings,
                      In every pure enjoyment wealthy,
                 Blithe and beautiful bird she sings,
                      For body and mind are hale and healthy.
                 Her eyes they thrill with right goodwill—
                      Her heart is light as a floating feather—
                 As pure and bright as the mountain rill
                      That leaps and laughs in the Highland heather!
                           Go search the world, etc.</div>
